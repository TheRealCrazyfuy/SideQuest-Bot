Enable Power-Saving Modes:\nActivate Power Saving Mode or Ultra Power Saving Mode via the quick settings panel.\n\n2. Manage Connectivity:\nDisable mobile data and network connections when not required.\n\n3. Optimize Display Settings:\nAvoid using live/dynamic wallpapers.\nReduce screen brightness.\nSet a shorter screen timeout period.\nSelect a lower screen refresh rate (e.g., 60Hz or 90Hz).\n\n4. Manage Applications:\nRegularly close unused background applications to conserve power and free up RAM.\nPerform routine phone memory cleanup.\nNavigate to Palm Manager > Battery Management > App Smart Management to disable auto-start and\nbackground activity permissions for non-essential third-party apps.\n\n5. Control 5G Usage:\nBe aware that 5G connectivity may increase battery consumption; enable it only as needed.\n\n6. Manage Location Services:\n- Disable location services (GPS) when not in use.\nKey Recommendation:\nFor optimal battery performance and extended usage, proactively managing display settings, application behavior, and connectivity options is essential."

        "reply": "# Is the image quality of the front camera poor or unclear?\n\n- The REDMAGIC 10S Pro uses a seventh-generation under-screen camera with high-transmittance material.\n- However, the image quality may appear slightly poor in backlit or dark environments.\n- Adjusting the shooting angle can help improve results.\n- We are also continuously optimizing this through software updates.\n\n# Why are front camera photos or videos blurry?\n\n- Since the REDMAGIC 10S Pro uses an under-screen camera, some imaging limitations may occur.\n- However, the imaging has been optimized to industry-leading levels.\n- AI algorithms are also used to further enhance the clarity of photos and videos.\n\n# Can you see a circle or difference at the front camera position?\n\n- Yes, you might notice a slight difference in the camera area compared to the rest of the screen.\n- This is due to special driving circuit designs required for the under-screen camera to function properly.\n--> It’s a result of current technical limitations, not a fault.\n- Increasing screen brightness can help minimize this visual difference.\n\n# Why does the front camera area have a color difference?\n\n- The slight color difference is due to the same special driving circuits used for the under-screen camera.\n- It helps enable both display and camera functionality in the same area. This is a known limitation of current under-screen technology and not a defect.\n- Increasing brightness can help reduce its visibility.\n"
