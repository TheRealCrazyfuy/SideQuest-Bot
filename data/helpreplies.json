Here's how to safely clean the internal fan! 🌀\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 What You’ll Need:\n- 🪥 *Dry toothbrush* (optional, for dust buildup)\n- 💨 *Canned air* (or similar air pressure)\n- 📱 Your Redmagic phone\n\n---\n\n### 🪛 Steps:\n\n1. 🔌 **Turn the phone OFF**  \n   Make sure the device is powered down to avoid any damage.\n\n2. 📦 **Remove the phone case** *(if you have one)*\n\n3. 🪥 **Brush off dust**  \n   Gently use a toothbrush to remove **larger particles** from the **intake vent**  \n   - 🧩 *On the 7 series: it's on the back*  \n   - 📏 *On other models: it's on the side*  \n   *(You can skip this step if your fan isn't too dusty)*\n\n4. ↘️ **Tilt the phone sideways**  \n   Make sure the **air outtake vent points DOWNWARD** — this helps dust fall out more easily!\n\n5. 💨 **Blow air into the intake vent**  \n   Use **short, strong bursts** with canned air. Repeat a few times until clean.\n\n6. 🔄 **Turn the phone back ON**  \n   Set the **internal fan to MAX RPM** for about **10 seconds** to flush out any remaining dust.\n\n---\n\n### 🎉 Aaaand your done!\nCleaning regularly helps performance and fan longevity!\n\n---\n\n📹 **Video Tutorial (by someone else):**  \n[Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/XcpJrl9gWN0?si=xd-_vml4wXZO5fch)"

Enable Power-Saving Modes:\nActivate Power Saving Mode or Ultra Power Saving Mode via the quick settings panel.\n\n2. Manage Connectivity:\nDisable mobile data and network connections when not required.\n\n3. Optimize Display Settings:\nAvoid using live/dynamic wallpapers.\nReduce screen brightness.\nSet a shorter screen timeout period.\nSelect a lower screen refresh rate (e.g., 60Hz or 90Hz).\n\n4. Manage Applications:\nRegularly close unused background applications to conserve power and free up RAM.\nPerform routine phone memory cleanup.\nNavigate to Palm Manager > Battery Management > App Smart Management to disable auto-start and\nbackground activity permissions for non-essential third-party apps.\n\n5. Control 5G Usage:\nBe aware that 5G connectivity may increase battery consumption; enable it only as needed.\n\n6. Manage Location Services:\n- Disable location services (GPS) when not in use.\nKey Recommendation:\nFor optimal battery performance and extended usage, proactively managing display settings, application behavior, and connectivity options is essential."
